1
00:00:26,288 --> 00:00:27,524
Obviously, this is the living room.

2
00:00:27,579 --> 00:00:29,055
There's a fully stocked bar in the den,
stock:1.股票
    2.v 进货 备有 
    3.I'm trying to change file 

3
00:00:29,112 --> 00:00:30,427
and the home theater is downstairs.

4
00:00:30,483 --> 00:00:32,229
Wow. So, your boss launches
one style website
launch: v deliver 
5
00:00:32,283 --> 00:00:33,707
and she can afford all of this?                                 

6
00:00:33,763 --> 00:00:35,106
I wish "1950s closeted father"

7
00:00:35,161 --> 00:00:36,584
was a look people were clamoring for.

8
00:00:36,639 --> 00:00:38,036
Oh, it is not that simple.

9
00:00:38,091 --> 00:00:40,079
The formula for NERP is very specific...

10
00:00:40,134 --> 00:00:42,123
former actress plus
confidence based on nothing

11
00:00:42,178 --> 00:00:44,058
equals millions in sales
of iffy wellness products.
wellness:health
iffy:uncertain suspicious 
12
00:00:44,114 --> 00:00:45,538
We should get her a gift
for letting us stay here,

13
00:00:45,593 --> 00:00:46,693
but what do you give someone
who's researching

14
00:00:46,749 --> 00:00:48,656
charcoal toothbrushes in Sri Lanka?
charcoal: 木炭
toothbrush: 
15
00:00:48,895 --> 00:00:50,131
Oh, actually, she's judging

16
00:00:50,185 --> 00:00:51,662
a placenta-cooking contest in Minsk.
placenta: 胎盘 
17
00:00:51,718 --> 00:00:53,760
Maybe we should stay away
from the fridge.

18
00:00:53,816 --> 00:00:54,998
So, we're in wine country.

19
00:00:55,052 --> 00:00:56,126
When does the wine tasting start,

20
00:00:56,182 --> 00:00:57,201
because I can use it after

21
00:00:57,258 --> 00:00:58,491
the public bashing I've had to endure.
bash:猛击   try not bash into the wall
endure:         
22
00:00:58,548 --> 00:01:00,348
Here we go. No more boo-hooing, Manny.

23
00:01:00,403 --> 00:01:01,342
The review wasn't that bad.

24
00:01:01,398 --> 00:01:03,090
He called my portrayal
of Inspector Poirot
portrayal:portrait
25
00:01:03,145 --> 00:01:04,272
"unconvincing," "not believable,"

26
00:01:04,329 --> 00:01:06,047
"hard to buy,"
and "ironically redundant".
redundant:extra 
27
00:01:06,102 --> 00:01:06,962
Hey, Mitch, Cam,

28
00:01:07,017 --> 00:01:07,876
now that you guys have had a chance

29
00:01:07,930 --> 00:01:08,871
to sleep on my performance,

30
00:01:08,926 --> 00:01:10,187
what did you think?

31
00:01:10,244 --> 00:01:11,988
- It was a tricky part.
- Yeah, and I don't blame you.

32
00:01:12,045 --> 00:01:13,064
I blame whoever cast you.
cast:抛
    计算
    演员阵容

33
00:01:15,594 --> 00:01:17,447
Finally, the closet part of the tour.

34
00:01:17,503 --> 00:01:21,185
My boss left each of you
a very special robe.
robe:long clothes
35
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:22,609
They minimize inflammation
inflammation:炎症 发火
36
00:01:22,664 --> 00:01:24,331
and gently exfoliate your skin
exfoliate:使脱皮 
37
00:01:24,386 --> 00:01:25,324
whilst you wear them.
whilst:while 当。。。的时候
38
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:26,750
That's weird. I only see six robes.

39
00:01:26,806 --> 00:01:27,825
That's what's weird about them?

40
00:01:27,881 --> 00:01:29,411
Oh, one last thing...

41
00:01:29,467 --> 00:01:31,133
Do not touch the tiara
tiara:女性头饰 王冠

42
00:01:31,187 --> 00:01:32,530
on display in the drawing room.

43
00:01:32,586 --> 00:01:33,902
It is very delicate.

44
00:01:33,957 --> 00:01:34,923
Got it?

45
00:01:34,979 --> 00:01:36,294
Sorry, honey. You're just...
You're doing that thing

46
00:01:36,350 --> 00:01:37,854
where you look like
a really intense baby deer.
intense:fierce, forceful 
deer: 鹿
47
00:01:37,910 --> 00:01:39,171
Oh, the scarier you try to be,

48
00:01:39,226 --> 00:01:41,161
- the more adorable you are.
- I know!

49
00:01:41,216 --> 00:01:42,048
Whatever. I have, like,

50
00:01:42,104 --> 00:01:43,339
a million errands to run for my boss.
errand:duty,task 

51
00:01:43,394 --> 00:01:44,951
Hang on. Since, uh, no one's called dibs
dibs:
52
00:01:45,008 --> 00:01:46,996
on the master bedroom,
I assume it's up for grabs.
master bedroom: main bedroom 主人的卧室 
up for grabs:可以争取 
grab:grasp grip seize cluth 
53
00:01:47,051 --> 00:01:48,635
Oh, actually, there are only
three guest bedrooms upstairs,

54
00:01:48,691 --> 00:01:50,061
so you'll have to sleep in there, okay?

55
00:01:50,922 --> 00:01:52,291
The maid's quarters?
maid: demestic， 佣人
quarter:四分之一 住宿 

56
00:01:52,347 --> 00:01:53,344
But I'll be right next
to the creaky do...
creaky: 老朽的 吱吱作响的 
57
00:01:53,364 --> 00:01:54,609
You know, if you want,

58
00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:56,459
- I can put some oil on that.
- Oh, no, no, no. Don't.

59
00:01:56,515 --> 00:01:58,152
These are traditional
Tibetan creaking hinges.
creaking:嘎吱嘎吱声 发出嘎吱嘎吱声
hinge:脚链 门把 
60
00:01:59,687 --> 00:02:00,493
We need those.

00:02:11,653 --> 00:02:12,618
- Whoa. Go easy.
- Trust me, Dad.

63
00:02:12,674 --> 00:02:14,501
Right now, I could really use this.

64
00:02:15,039 --> 00:02:17,108
<i>I love Phil. Let's just
get that out of the way first,</i>
get that out of the way:  弄清楚 
65
00:02:17,163 --> 00:02:18,722
but he has these bear slippers.
slipper:拖鞋
66
00:02:18,777 --> 00:02:20,173
I don't know where they came from,

67
00:02:20,229 --> 00:02:21,572
probably the same place that sells

68
00:02:21,626 --> 00:02:23,668
pinky rings and other things
that make it difficult
pinky: a little pink  
69
00:02:23,724 --> 00:02:25,120
to see your husband as a sexual being.

70
00:02:26,197 --> 00:02:28,320
Oh, my gosh. I don't think
I'm allowed here

71
00:02:28,374 --> 00:02:29,691
in my bare feet.
bare:bald naked uncovered
72
00:02:31,817 --> 00:02:32,971
Fortunately, I have a tactic
tactic:strategy
73
00:02:33,026 --> 00:02:34,234
for getting rid of things that I hate.

74
00:02:34,290 --> 00:02:35,902
I suggest that Phil
brings them on vacation,

75
00:02:35,957 --> 00:02:37,649
and then I forget to repack them.
pack:打包
76
00:02:37,705 --> 00:02:38,645
Thanks.

77
00:02:38,699 --> 00:02:39,828
Dollar-sign necktie...
necktie: neck - tie 
78
00:02:39,882 --> 00:02:41,494
I flung it over Niagara Falls.
fling:cast 抛 扔 
79
00:02:41,549 --> 00:02:43,537
The belt buckle with "Pimp" in crystals?
belt buckle :皮条扣 
pimp:皮条 男妓 
crystal: 晶体 水晶 
80
00:02:43,592 --> 00:02:44,639
Chucked it in the Grand Canyon.
chuck: cast , fling 
canyon: 峡谷 
81
00:02:44,695 --> 00:02:45,931
Huh. I wonder if that's what Gloria did

82
00:02:45,985 --> 00:02:47,382
to my denim vest in the Galápagos.
denim:粗布 丁尼布 
vest:背心 汗衫 
83
00:02:47,437 --> 00:02:48,727
I just gotta sneak out tonight
sneak: 偷偷溜出 鬼鬼祟祟做 
84
00:02:48,781 --> 00:02:50,420
and disappear those
bear slippers in the woods.
wood:forest 
85
00:02:51,390 --> 00:02:52,544
Am I a terrible person?

86
00:02:52,599 --> 00:02:54,453
No, but there might be a pattern
of desecrating national parks
desecrate:亵渎 
pattern:模式，图案，方式 
      a repeated decorative design 
    the school is located a few kilometers away and is run on the pattern of other army schools）
87
00:02:54,508 --> 00:02:55,420
you might want to look at.

88
00:02:58,192 --> 00:02:59,669
That's enough, Chubs.

89
00:02:59,725 --> 00:03:00,691
What are you doing?

90
00:03:01,526 --> 00:03:03,030
Stella's been severely depressed
severely:badly ,seriously
depressed:dispirited     反:spirited  spirit 精神 
91 
00:03:03,085 --> 00:03:04,347
because her best friend, Norman,

92
00:03:04,402 --> 00:03:06,471
the next-door neighbor's dog, just died.

93
00:03:06,527 --> 00:03:08,460
She won't even do
her favorite trick anymore.

94
00:03:08,517 --> 00:03:09,644
Stella.

95
00:03:09,699 --> 00:03:10,666
Stella, speak.

96
00:03:10,721 --> 00:03:13,032
Speak. Like you're saying "Hello".

97
00:03:13,086 --> 00:03:15,318
Hellooo! Hel-Hellooo!

98
00:03:15,372 --> 00:03:16,231
Hello?

99
00:03:17,039 --> 00:03:18,759
I wanted to bring Stella
on the trip to cheer her up.

100
00:03:18,813 --> 00:03:20,882
She never sees seasons,
but Gloria wanted one night

101
00:03:20,937 --> 00:03:21,957
with just the two of us in bed,

102
00:03:22,014 --> 00:03:23,517
so I did the only sensible thing.
sensible:可感知到的 
    通情达理的 
103
00:03:23,573 --> 00:03:24,700
You left her at home with a dog sitter?
sitter :待人照看小孩的 
    当模特的人 
104
00:03:24,755 --> 00:03:26,098
Checked her in the hotel down the road.

105
00:03:26,154 --> 00:03:27,335
I'm trying to get some wine in Gloria

106
00:03:27,391 --> 00:03:29,674
so she passes out early
and I can sneak off and feed Stella.
pass out :喝的烂醉 

107
00:03:29,729 --> 00:03:31,323
The hotel down the
road? You mean the Ritz?

108
00:03:31,343 --> 00:03:32,228
I had points. Calm down.

109
00:03:32,606 --> 00:03:34,889
Oh, how cool. This is both
an opener and a stopper.

110
00:03:34,946 --> 00:03:35,830
Nice.

111
00:03:35,886 --> 00:03:36,772
Oh, I guess what it does for bottles,

112
00:03:36,827 --> 00:03:38,654
it also does for conversations.

113
00:03:38,709 --> 00:03:40,590
Wait, is that... Ronaldo!

114
00:03:40,645 --> 00:03:41,962
Mitchell!

115
00:03:42,016 --> 00:03:43,493
What a surprise.

116
00:03:43,549 --> 00:03:45,080
And who is this?

117
00:03:45,135 --> 00:03:47,069
I always assumed I was
your sexiest Latin friend.

118
00:03:47,124 --> 00:03:48,467
This is Gloria. Gloria, Ronaldo.

119
00:03:48,523 --> 00:03:49,732
- Bolivian?
- Guatemalan.

120
00:03:49,786 --> 00:03:51,397
- Venezuelan?
- Colombian.

121
00:03:51,454 --> 00:03:52,984
- Mm-hmm.
- Not sure what this is.

122
00:03:53,039 --> 00:03:54,840
Um, so w-what are you doing in town?

123
00:03:54,895 --> 00:03:57,504
Oh, just picking up some wine
for a party I'm catering...
cater:筹办 提供酒食
124
00:03:57,532 --> 00:03:58,703
at Oprah Winfrey's.

125
00:03:58,732 --> 00:03:59,578
- What?
- Stop it!

126
00:03:59,606 --> 00:04:01,776
- Oh, what, is that a big deal?
- Don't you be coy.
coy:shy ，忸怩作态的
127
00:04:01,835 --> 00:04:03,877
You know the power dynamic
just shifted between us.

128
00:04:03,933 --> 00:04:05,947
If you want, I can get you two
into the party.

129
00:04:06,002 --> 00:04:07,614
- Get out!
- You would do that for us?

130
00:04:07,670 --> 00:04:09,066
Only because I like you so much.

131
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:11,083
I like you so much, too!

132
00:04:11,162 --> 00:04:12,208
That was a quick thaw.
thaw:解冻 
133
00:04:12,265 --> 00:04:13,661
It can only be the two of you,
though. No Cameron.

134
00:04:13,715 --> 00:04:14,736
Pepper would kill me.

135
00:04:14,792 --> 00:04:16,107
Right. Cam's in a feud
with Ronaldo's husband

feud:dispute, fight  for long time 

136
00:04:16,163 --> 00:04:17,667
over what type of cracker
belongs on a cheese platter.
cracker:cookie 饼干 
platter: 拼盘  唱片 

137
00:04:17,721 --> 00:04:19,414
Water cracker. The cheese is the star.

138
00:04:20,517 --> 00:04:21,564
- This isn't our fight.
- No.

139
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:23,044
I have to run.
I'll text you the address.

140
00:04:23,117 --> 00:04:24,729
Okay. Bye-bye.

141
00:04:24,783 --> 00:04:26,664
Can you believe this? We're
going to a party at Oprah's.

142
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:28,761
What if we become friends with her?

143
00:04:28,816 --> 00:04:30,670
What if we get our own TV show?

144
00:04:30,726 --> 00:04:32,095
Who's gonna pick up Joe from school?!

145
00:04:32,150 --> 00:04:33,708
Gloria... we'll have drivers.

146
00:04:35,101 --> 00:04:36,606
- Tuesday Company!
- Tuesday Company!

147
00:04:36,661 --> 00:04:38,541
Cam, Mitch, Claire, and I signed
up for a hip-hop class.
hip-hop:即兴音乐 嘻哈 
148
00:04:38,596 --> 00:04:39,831
We knew it was legit when they asked us

149
00:04:39,886 --> 00:04:41,633
to graffiti our names
on the sign-up wall.

150
00:04:41,959 --> 00:04:43,301
Right leg, come on.

151
00:04:43,357 --> 00:04:44,647
Unh. Wrap those arms, come on.
wrap:缠绕 隐藏 
152
00:04:44,701 --> 00:04:46,124
Unh. Unh.

153
00:04:46,181 --> 00:04:47,630
And yah!

154
00:04:47,686 --> 00:04:49,809
I like it. Nice job, everybody!

155
00:04:49,863 --> 00:04:50,750
Great. That's great.

156
00:04:50,804 --> 00:04:51,905
Hey, Sho Nuff. Bomb class.

157
00:04:51,961 --> 00:04:53,008
Yeah, yeah. Really sick.

158
00:04:53,063 --> 00:04:54,244
Hey, man. You two were hitting
it hard out there.

159
00:04:54,299 --> 00:04:55,428
I was really believing your movements.

160
00:04:55,482 --> 00:04:57,202
Are you... saying we brought it?

161
00:04:57,258 --> 00:04:58,574
I'm saying y'all crushed it.
crush:压碎  迷恋 
162
00:04:58,628 --> 00:05:00,024
Keep it up. All right?

163
00:05:00,081 --> 00:05:00,939
- Okay.
- Hit it.

164
00:05:00,995 --> 00:05:02,041
All right. There you go.

165
00:05:03,414 --> 00:05:04,487
- Cameron?
- Philip?

166
00:05:04,543 --> 00:05:06,155
- Did you hear that?
- You mean when our dance instructor

167
00:05:06,211 --> 00:05:07,741
told us we were basically
street-dance superstars?

168
00:05:07,796 --> 00:05:09,516
Did you notice how he singled us out?
single： adj 
     v choose  
169
00:05:09,618 --> 00:05:11,311
He didn't even mention Mitch or Claire.

170
00:05:11,366 --> 00:05:12,628
It's like he's
saying they're holding us back.
hold sb back :阻碍 。。前进 
171
00:05:12,684 --> 00:05:13,543
Okay. You know what?

172
00:05:13,597 --> 00:05:14,941
We need to shed our dead-weight spouses.
shed: 拜托 流出 
dead-weight :沉重的
spouse:配偶 
173
00:05:14,996 --> 00:05:16,312
There is nobody
I would rather impress more

174
00:05:16,366 --> 00:05:17,926
- than Sho Nuff.
- True dat.
     ==== True that 

175
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:20,022
- No, True Dat's just the DJ.
- I don't care what he thinks.

176
00:05:20,446 --> 00:05:23,751
Turns out, Cam and I
make tremendous dance partners.
tremendous:amazing  ,  fantastic ,giant
177
00:05:23,807 --> 00:05:25,042
Our bodies are so in tune,
in tune :和谐一致 
178
00:05:25,097 --> 00:05:26,386
it's like we finish each other's...

179
00:05:26,441 --> 00:05:27,462
...sequences.
        顺序 ，顺序事件
180
00:05:27,516 --> 00:05:29,747
Phil starts a move,
and I instinctually complete it.
instinctual: 本能的
181
00:05:29,802 --> 00:05:31,521
And, yeah,
it's as powerful as it sounds.

182
00:05:31,576 --> 00:05:33,081
Oh, my gosh. Did you ever think

183
00:05:33,135 --> 00:05:34,237
a farm boy from Missouri

184
00:05:34,292 --> 00:05:35,661
and... and a real-estate agent
from Key West, Florida,

185
00:05:35,717 --> 00:05:36,872
would get the opportunity to audition
audition: 试音 面试   audience听众 
186
00:05:36,927 --> 00:05:38,673
for the prestigious Tuesday Company?
prestigious:honored 有声望的 
187
00:05:38,728 --> 00:05:40,286
And it only costs slightly more
than regular classes.

188
00:05:40,341 --> 00:05:42,357
We could be the greatest
masters-level hip-hop duo
duo: 二人组合 
189
00:05:42,412 --> 00:05:43,996
- since Pump Up and The Jam!
- I know!

190
00:05:44,052 --> 00:05:45,475
Callback's tomorrow, so
we'll have to sneak out tonight

191
00:05:45,530 --> 00:05:46,551
for a final rehearsal.

192
00:05:46,607 --> 00:05:47,868
You... You brought the outfit
in case we got it, right?

193
00:05:47,924 --> 00:05:49,400
"In case"? Good one, Phil.

194
00:05:49,456 --> 00:05:51,470
I'm having a hard time resisting
dancing with joy, are you?

195
00:05:51,527 --> 00:05:53,029
- Me-Meet at the grapes.
- Okay.

196
00:05:53,086 --> 00:05:55,046
Man, it took forever
to find a parking spot.

197
00:05:55,101 --> 00:05:57,221
I could really use a
sip of a chewy Cabernet.

198
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:59,618
You can't drink. You have to stay sober
to drive the rest of us home.

199
00:05:59,672 --> 00:06:01,526
Wait, is that why I'm here?
To be the designated driver?

200
00:06:01,581 --> 00:06:02,709
If you need a title, sure.

201
00:06:08,656 --> 00:06:09,488
Okay, the front door's too loud.

202
00:06:09,543 --> 00:06:11,020
We can get to the driveway this way.

203
00:06:11,894 --> 00:06:14,044
I look like Miss Universe.

204
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:16,088
What are you doing?
Haley said not to touch that.

205
00:06:16,143 --> 00:06:17,674
- Ow!
- Let me see.

206
00:06:17,728 --> 00:06:18,991
Clean cut.

207
00:06:19,046 --> 00:06:20,442
- Those are real diamonds!
- Leave 'em. Come on.

208
00:06:22,003 --> 00:06:24,449
- Cam, walk this way.
- Oh. Ooh, ooh, ooh!

209
00:06:25,418 --> 00:06:26,880
Mixing metals is very
in-fashion right now.

210
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:27,810
No, no. Hey, hey, hey, hey.

211
00:06:27,864 --> 00:06:29,906
In 18 hours, Sho Nuff is gonna
be rating our dance skills

212
00:06:29,963 --> 00:06:32,273
on a scale of one to "Dayum"! Come on!

213
00:06:35,439 --> 00:06:37,186
All right. All right.

214
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:38,771
Butt... here.

215
00:06:38,826 --> 00:06:40,007
Just one more treat.

216
00:06:40,064 --> 00:06:40,949
Here.

217
00:06:43,242 --> 00:06:44,451
Shh. We'll just do this quick.

218
00:06:44,505 --> 00:06:46,386
Shh. Here you go.

219
00:06:46,442 --> 00:06:47,542
Gorgeous!

220
00:06:48,931 --> 00:06:50,139
- Dad?
- Oh!

221
00:06:50,196 --> 00:06:51,296
I thought you were Gloria.

222
00:06:51,350 --> 00:06:52,641
Wh-Why is Stella here?

223
00:06:52,696 --> 00:06:53,688
I was going to feed her at the hotel...

224
00:06:53,744 --> 00:06:55,087
she's clearly in a bad way.

225
00:06:55,142 --> 00:06:56,189
She trashed the room.

226
00:06:56,245 --> 00:06:57,669
It looked like The Who
was staying there.

227
00:06:57,723 --> 00:06:59,092
So, I'm gonna stash her
in the guesthouse,

228
00:06:59,149 --> 00:07:00,384
brush her fur until she goes to sleep.

229
00:07:00,439 --> 00:07:01,297
Stella!

230
00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:05,438
What?

231
00:07:05,494 --> 00:07:06,917
I am prom queen?!

232
00:07:06,972 --> 00:07:08,045
It's not... It's not Ashley Walls

233
00:07:08,101 --> 00:07:09,848
who got the pity vote
after her car accident?

234
00:07:09,903 --> 00:07:10,950
Thank you.

235
00:07:11,005 --> 00:07:12,107
Thank you.

236
00:07:12,636 --> 00:07:14,463
Okay. Now we need to be
strategic if we're gonna hit

237
00:07:14,518 --> 00:07:16,103
all of Oprah's important rooms, okay?

238
00:07:16,159 --> 00:07:18,093
Her home office, her gift-wrapping room,

239
00:07:18,148 --> 00:07:20,540
her temperature-controlled vault
of cozy sweaters.

240
00:07:20,595 --> 00:07:22,018
But what if Gayle is there?

241
00:07:22,074 --> 00:07:23,039
Do we stop to talk to her?

242
00:07:23,095 --> 00:07:25,352
No. No Gayle. There's no time.

243
00:07:25,407 --> 00:07:26,428
Okay, that-that's the third house

244
00:07:26,483 --> 00:07:27,852
in this compound that we passed.

245
00:07:27,909 --> 00:07:28,847
How will we know when we get

246
00:07:28,903 --> 00:07:30,164
to Oprah's actual hou...

247
00:07:31,698 --> 00:07:32,719
Oh, my God.

248
00:07:38,368 --> 00:07:39,442
Okay.

249
00:07:51,811 --> 00:07:53,154
I'm so sorry.

250
00:07:53,209 --> 00:07:54,337
I'm sorry.

251
00:07:54,392 --> 00:07:56,380
- I was a beat early on the booty drop.
- No, no, no.

252
00:07:56,434 --> 00:07:58,073
It was me. I was a beat late
on the chest pop.

253
00:07:58,082 --> 00:07:59,802
It's weird, but I'm... I'm nervous.

254
00:07:59,857 --> 00:08:00,822
I am, too. But you know what?

255
00:08:00,877 --> 00:08:02,302
We... We just have to relax

256
00:08:02,356 --> 00:08:04,076
and remember we're... we're
just a couple guys dancing.

257
00:08:04,131 --> 00:08:05,393
Who are we kidding?!

258
00:08:05,449 --> 00:08:07,033
Getting Tuesday Company would be epic!

259
00:08:07,089 --> 00:08:08,431
I know! We get our own cubbies.

260
00:08:08,487 --> 00:08:09,802
We don't have to throw our
keys and wallet in the corner anymore.

261
00:08:09,859 --> 00:08:12,436
Didn't the Tuesdoggs perform at
the WNBA All-Star Game last year?

262
00:08:12,505 --> 00:08:14,196
It would be life-changing, but
we have to stop talking about

263
00:08:14,253 --> 00:08:15,218
how great it would be.

264
00:08:15,274 --> 00:08:16,267
- That's what's throwing us off.
- Right.

265
00:08:16,322 --> 00:08:17,639
- For now, it's... We're just... Hey.
- Hey.

266
00:08:17,693 --> 00:08:18,580
- Here's two guys...
- Dancing.

267
00:08:18,635 --> 00:08:19,575
- We're dancing. Yeah.
- We're dancing.

268
00:08:19,630 --> 00:08:20,676
- Let's take it from the top. All right.
- Yep.

269
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:24,468
Five, six, seven, eight, and...

270
00:08:24,523 --> 00:08:25,382
And that's my bad.

271
00:08:25,437 --> 00:08:26,269
Okay.

272
00:08:28,379 --> 00:08:30,179
Where have you been? I turned
around and you were gone.

273
00:08:30,234 --> 00:08:32,115
I was in Oprah's bed!

274
00:08:32,170 --> 00:08:34,292
- Guess her sleep number.
- I don't have to.

275
00:08:34,347 --> 00:08:36,255
- I touched her. I touched Oprah!
- What?!

276
00:08:36,311 --> 00:08:37,196
Well, technically,

277
00:08:37,252 --> 00:08:38,540
I brushed the edge
of her gown with my finger.

278
00:08:38,596 --> 00:08:40,638
But look... my cut's magically healed.

279
00:08:40,693 --> 00:08:42,116
And I heard they have baby elephants

280
00:08:42,172 --> 00:08:44,079
carrying everyone to the south lawn

281
00:08:44,134 --> 00:08:46,148
to see a living chess match. Let's go!

282
00:08:46,291 --> 00:08:47,175
Wait, no, Gloria. Gloria, Come on.

283
00:08:47,232 --> 00:08:48,978
We said we'd only stay for an hour.

284
00:08:49,033 --> 00:08:50,913
We have to get back to our normal lives.

285
00:08:50,969 --> 00:08:52,473
- But how?!
- I know.

286
00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:57,474
Leave them.

287
00:08:57,529 --> 00:08:59,543
Take it from me... if you get
a second chance at love,

288
00:08:59,599 --> 00:09:00,726
you grab it.

289
00:09:01,012 --> 00:09:03,107
<i>After the trauma of losing
her best friend, Norman,</i>

290
00:09:03,163 --> 00:09:04,828
<i>Stella's veil of depression was lifted</i>

291
00:09:04,885 --> 00:09:06,442
<i>by the promise of new romance.</i>

292
00:09:06,497 --> 00:09:08,377
She realized she could love again.

293
00:09:08,571 --> 00:09:09,778
You can't separate them, Claire.

294
00:09:09,834 --> 00:09:11,420
I'm taking that slipper home with me.

295
00:09:11,475 --> 00:09:13,597
And risk Phil seeing it the next
time we're at your house? Forget it.

296
00:09:13,653 --> 00:09:15,318
Stella's had her fun. This is over.

297
00:09:15,372 --> 00:09:17,038
Why is this so hard for you to accept?

298
00:09:17,093 --> 00:09:18,867
Is it because it's a dog and a slipper?

299
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:32,685
My bad.

300
00:09:32,774 --> 00:09:34,169
- Again.
- No, no. No, no.

301
00:09:34,188 --> 00:09:35,935
That's on me. I'm... I'm...
I'm... I'm still in my head.

302
00:09:35,990 --> 00:09:37,117
Let's face it, Cam.
This isn't about nerves.

303
00:09:37,173 --> 00:09:38,570
It's about me losing
whatever spark I once had.

304
00:09:38,625 --> 00:09:39,976
It's like someone sucked
the funk right out of me!

305
00:09:39,996 --> 00:09:42,172
No, I'm the problem. It's like I've lost
the key to the lock on my pop.

306
00:09:42,227 --> 00:09:43,194
Just...go on without me.

307
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:44,942
I'm holding you back!
I mean, nuff is nuff.

308
00:09:44,997 --> 00:09:47,603
Maybe Rob Base was wrong.
It takes one to make a thing go right.

309
00:09:47,658 --> 00:09:49,512
- Is it possible...
- Just say it.

310
00:09:49,568 --> 00:09:51,180
...that we're just Monday dancers?

311
00:09:56,603 --> 00:09:57,570
Is it better?

312
00:09:57,626 --> 00:09:58,967
No, I'm still getting
a hint of elephant.

313
00:09:59,024 --> 00:10:00,555
- Get out.
- W... I'm just being honest.

314
00:10:00,610 --> 00:10:03,082
No, we have to push the car
the last 50 feet to the house...

315
00:10:03,137 --> 00:10:04,265
...so that they don't hear us coming.

316
00:10:06,528 --> 00:10:08,597
I feel like some of Oprah's strength
must've rubbed off on me.

317
00:10:08,651 --> 00:10:09,805
I bet I could
carry this car up.

318
00:10:09,861 --> 00:10:10,962
Are you sure this is in neutral?

319
00:10:12,497 --> 00:10:13,838
What is this?!

320
00:10:14,675 --> 00:10:16,849
Did you steal this candy dish
from Oprah's house?

321
00:10:16,906 --> 00:10:19,889
It has her initials engraved.

322
00:10:19,944 --> 00:10:22,039
I couldn't help it. I wanted a souvenir.

323
00:10:22,094 --> 00:10:24,190
But you said that we couldn't
bring any evidence in here,

324
00:10:24,245 --> 00:10:25,507
and you didn't even let me take

325
00:10:25,562 --> 00:10:27,121
the party napkin that had a cartoon

326
00:10:27,176 --> 00:10:29,299
of her hugging children of many colors!

327
00:10:29,354 --> 00:10:30,454
Okay, I'm sorry.

328
00:10:30,511 --> 00:10:32,713
What if... What if we share
custody of the candy dish?

329
00:10:32,768 --> 00:10:33,923
Okay, fine.

330
00:10:33,979 --> 00:10:35,536
But I get it for the holidays.

331
00:10:35,591 --> 00:10:37,714
Coming.

332
00:10:38,953 --> 00:10:40,832
Oh, hey, sorry. I forgot my keys
in the drawing room.

333
00:10:42,286 --> 00:10:43,656
Okay, where did I put them?

334
00:10:43,711 --> 00:10:44,812
They were right here, right?

335
00:10:44,866 --> 00:10:46,290
And right where I thought I left them.

336
00:10:46,346 --> 00:10:47,743
Wait a minute. What is that?

337
00:10:47,797 --> 00:10:48,871
Oh, my God.

338
00:10:48,928 --> 00:10:50,028
Oh, my God! The tiara! It's cracked!

339
00:10:50,083 --> 00:10:51,049
Who did this?!

340
00:10:51,106 --> 00:10:52,179
I'll get to the bottom of this.

341
00:10:52,234 --> 00:10:54,383
I don't care what some
feeble-minded vulgarian says.

342
00:10:54,438 --> 00:10:56,831
Manny Delgado knows how to play
the role of an inspector.

343
00:10:56,886 --> 00:10:58,981
- I'll text everyone to come downstairs.
- Thank you.

344
00:11:00,810 --> 00:11:01,643
No!

345
00:11:01,698 --> 00:11:02,530
Oh, no.

346
00:11:02,585 --> 00:11:03,579
Oh, hell no.

347
00:11:05,675 --> 00:11:07,286
Okay. Wait, wait, Dad.
We need an excuse!

348
00:11:07,341 --> 00:11:08,926
People are gonna wonder
why we weren't in bed.

349
00:11:08,980 --> 00:11:10,430
Um, tell them that, uh, uh...

350
00:11:10,486 --> 00:11:12,112
Oh! We were on the balcony
because we saw a moose.

351
00:11:12,133 --> 00:11:12,963
That's dumb.

352
00:11:12,986 --> 00:11:14,651
We'll tell them I'm heating up some milk
for you in the kitchen

353
00:11:14,706 --> 00:11:15,807
because your stomach hurts.

354
00:11:15,863 --> 00:11:17,824
Why? Because I was upset
that I saw a moose?

355
00:11:21,590 --> 00:11:23,202
Put this on.

356
00:11:23,256 --> 00:11:24,330
- I was early.
- I was late.

357
00:11:26,268 --> 00:11:27,449
Hurry, hurry!

358
00:11:27,504 --> 00:11:30,137
Whew! I'm still getting
strong notes of elephant off of you.

359
00:11:30,582 --> 00:11:31,925
- You may have to cut off all your hair.
- No!

360
00:11:33,379 --> 00:11:35,233
I'm sure you're wondering why
I've gathered you all here.

361
00:11:35,288 --> 00:11:37,275
Uh, the tiara's cracked.
You told us in your text.

362
00:11:37,330 --> 00:11:38,593
What I didn't tell you
is that I've vowed

363
00:11:38,648 --> 00:11:40,018
to find out who's responsible.

364
00:11:40,073 --> 00:11:41,416
Well, no, actually,
you did. It was a fairly long...

365
00:11:41,425 --> 00:11:43,091
Everyone's a suspect.

366
00:11:43,147 --> 00:11:44,408
Don't look at me.
I wasn't anywhere near it.

367
00:11:44,465 --> 00:11:46,317
What a surprise...
Phil feigning innocence.

368
00:11:46,373 --> 00:11:48,200
You're just everyone's
favorite Dad, right?

369
00:11:48,719 --> 00:11:50,144
Where were you when you got my text?

370
00:11:50,199 --> 00:11:51,784
Cam's, uh, stomach was upset,

371
00:11:51,838 --> 00:11:53,209
and I was warming up some milk for him.

372
00:11:53,264 --> 00:11:54,983
- Claire saw a moose.
- I did.

373
00:11:55,038 --> 00:11:57,537
And that's why we were on
the balcony when you texted us.

374
00:11:57,592 --> 00:11:58,559
Well, Gloria and I were in the den.

375
00:11:58,613 --> 00:11:59,903
I ran into her on my way out to my walk,

376
00:11:59,958 --> 00:12:01,059
and then we decided
to watch the moon together.

377
00:12:01,115 --> 00:12:02,000
The moon, huh?

378
00:12:02,055 --> 00:12:04,850
Seems unlikely given tonight
is moonless!

379
00:12:04,905 --> 00:12:05,952
No matter.

380
00:12:06,334 --> 00:12:08,886
So, did any of you go through
this room at any point?

381
00:12:10,661 --> 00:12:12,220
Sounds to me like everybody was inside

382
00:12:12,275 --> 00:12:13,510
doing whatever they were
supposed to be doing.

383
00:12:14,013 --> 00:12:16,242
That's odd because I found
this door slightly open,

384
00:12:16,298 --> 00:12:17,936
which means one of you was outside.

385
00:12:17,991 --> 00:12:19,415
When I find out who went out that door,

386
00:12:19,470 --> 00:12:20,760
quite sure I'll have my culprit.

387
00:12:20,815 --> 00:12:21,726
Hey, what's that?

388
00:12:23,638 --> 00:12:25,249
It appears to be two bottom halves

389
00:12:25,305 --> 00:12:26,808
of a gingerbread man melded together.

390
00:12:26,863 --> 00:12:28,691
Uh, it looks like a bone.
It's a dog treat.

391
00:12:28,746 --> 00:12:30,249
No, it's a human treat,

392
00:12:30,306 --> 00:12:32,642
and it's shaped like
a bone because it's full of calcium.

393
00:12:33,030 --> 00:12:34,238
I was snacking on them
earlier in the day

394
00:12:34,293 --> 00:12:35,393
and I must have dropped one.

395
00:12:37,224 --> 00:12:39,050
Mmm, they're delicious.

396
00:12:39,450 --> 00:12:40,577
And they're very good for you.

397
00:12:40,633 --> 00:12:41,572
Checks out.

398
00:12:42,568 --> 00:12:43,535
That's coming from upstairs!

399
00:12:43,590 --> 00:12:44,690
No, outside.

400
00:12:45,930 --> 00:12:47,299
Gloria, how did this happen?

401
00:12:47,354 --> 00:12:48,428
I have a theory.

402
00:12:48,483 --> 00:12:49,504
I once read about a moose

403
00:12:49,559 --> 00:12:50,874
that knocked a camper out of neutral.

404
00:12:50,930 --> 00:12:53,133
Perhaps the moose Claire saw earlier did
the same thing here.

405
00:12:53,189 --> 00:12:55,150
The hood's warm. Then don't lean on it.

406
00:12:55,490 --> 00:12:58,017
I admit it! Mitch and I...
we were outside.

407
00:12:58,071 --> 00:12:59,548
He wanted to talk to me about a problem

408
00:12:59,605 --> 00:13:02,049
he's having with Cam in the gay bedroom.

409
00:13:02,104 --> 00:13:03,232
Oh, so when it's me, it's a problem.

410
00:13:03,288 --> 00:13:04,979
When it's you, it's what happens
when you work out too much.

411
00:13:05,412 --> 00:13:08,125
It got cold, we went inside the car,

412
00:13:08,181 --> 00:13:09,173
I turned the heater on,

413
00:13:09,229 --> 00:13:11,997
and I must have accidentally
knocked it into neutral.

414
00:13:12,052 --> 00:13:13,663
So, it was all ready to roll
when the moose showed up.

415
00:13:13,719 --> 00:13:15,600
Hey, uh, what's
this candy dish doing here?

416
00:13:16,002 --> 00:13:17,184
Haley, please, I'm trying to think.

417
00:13:17,239 --> 00:13:18,555
But it could be evidence.

418
00:13:18,611 --> 00:13:20,168
What are the lights doing on
in the tennis court?!

419
00:13:23,315 --> 00:13:24,658
Now why would these chairs be out here,

420
00:13:24,713 --> 00:13:25,680
and how do they connect to the moose?

421
00:13:25,735 --> 00:13:28,342
These footprints are in a...
really weird pattern.

422
00:13:28,396 --> 00:13:29,821
Why do these steps feel so familiar?

423
00:13:29,876 --> 00:13:31,299
Cam and I were out here, um...

424
00:13:31,355 --> 00:13:33,503
We were in the kitchen, and
we heard a raccoon outside.

425
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:34,955
Yeah, yeah. So, we came out, we...

426
00:13:35,012 --> 00:13:37,052
we grabbed a couple chairs
to... to... to scare it off.

427
00:13:37,108 --> 00:13:39,042
We held... held them up like this,

428
00:13:39,097 --> 00:13:40,359
and, um, chased the raccoon,

429
00:13:40,414 --> 00:13:41,839
but it ran into some trash cans
and we were like...

430
00:13:41,893 --> 00:13:43,021
- Oh!
- Oh!

431
00:13:43,078 --> 00:13:45,278
And then, uh, it ran
up the court this way...

432
00:13:45,306 --> 00:13:46,275
- Yep.
- ...and then back a couple of steps

433
00:13:46,330 --> 00:13:48,740
and then forward again and then it
did a little spin.

434
00:13:48,769 --> 00:13:50,818
Yep. That was it. And then it
came back at us, and we were like...

435
00:13:50,891 --> 00:13:52,368
Right, left. Right, right,

436
00:13:52,423 --> 00:13:53,631
body roll, and spin.

437
00:13:53,686 --> 00:13:55,084
And then, it was just gone.

438
00:13:55,138 --> 00:13:56,131
What the hell was that?

439
00:13:56,188 --> 00:13:57,880
What is any of this? I can't
make sense of these clues.

440
00:13:57,935 --> 00:13:59,896
What kind of raccoon isn't scared off by
the presence of a moose?

441
00:13:59,952 --> 00:14:00,918
All we need to know

442
00:14:00,972 --> 00:14:03,204
is that Mitchell, Gloria, Cam, and Phil

443
00:14:03,258 --> 00:14:05,299
- are the four and only suspects.
- Not only!

444
00:14:07,066 --> 00:14:09,027
One at a time! Phil, go first.

445
00:14:09,083 --> 00:14:10,156
Well, that's a lot of pressure.

446
00:14:10,211 --> 00:14:11,581
Speak!

447
00:14:11,636 --> 00:14:12,442
What is that noise?

448
00:14:12,496 --> 00:14:13,651
It's like a dog saying, "Hello."

449
00:14:13,707 --> 00:14:14,862
Sounds to me like
a California barking moose.

450
00:14:14,916 --> 00:14:15,964
It came from up there.

451
00:14:17,202 --> 00:14:18,571
Hey.

452
00:14:18,627 --> 00:14:20,750
We were really in-sync talking
through that raccoon chase.

453
00:14:20,805 --> 00:14:22,388
It felt like maybe we
had our timing back again.

454
00:14:22,409 --> 00:14:23,276
It really did.

455
00:14:23,463 --> 00:14:25,907
Maybe we forgot dance isn't
about the fame or... or glory,

456
00:14:25,964 --> 00:14:28,031
but it's about telling a story
that takes your audience

457
00:14:28,088 --> 00:14:30,129
on a journey that ebbs and flows.

458
00:14:30,184 --> 00:14:31,070
Ebb and Flow.

459
00:14:31,986 --> 00:14:33,598
I think we just found our hip-hop names.

460
00:14:36,379 --> 00:14:37,668
Jay!

461
00:14:37,723 --> 00:14:39,255
- You brought Stella?!
- No!

462
00:14:39,309 --> 00:14:40,760
She must have tracked us here.

463
00:14:40,815 --> 00:14:42,346
What's that, girl?

464
00:14:42,401 --> 00:14:44,282
What? We left the stove on?

465
00:14:44,337 --> 00:14:45,734
- Well, that was weird.
- Wait, wait. Whoa, whoa.

466
00:14:45,789 --> 00:14:47,078
What is my slipper doing in here?

467
00:14:47,134 --> 00:14:48,853
I'm not wrong. It's cold, huh?

468
00:14:48,908 --> 00:14:50,843
Hey. Honey...

469
00:14:50,898 --> 00:14:52,509
We need to talk about this.

470
00:14:54,205 --> 00:14:55,735
- Um, Stella...
- She wants the slipper, Phil.

471
00:14:55,791 --> 00:14:56,758
Oh, my God.

472
00:14:57,325 --> 00:14:59,178
W-Why is Phil dressed
like a Beastie Boy?

473
00:14:59,235 --> 00:15:00,228
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

474
00:15:00,283 --> 00:15:02,781
You two did hip-hop without us!

475
00:15:02,837 --> 00:15:04,099
Okay, be-because you and Claire
were holding us back.

476
00:15:04,155 --> 00:15:05,820
Oh, please. We are
just as good as you are.

477
00:15:05,876 --> 00:15:07,276
It sounds like somebody
wants a dance-off.

478
00:15:07,296 --> 00:15:08,643
No. No one ever wants a dance-off.

479
00:15:08,698 --> 00:15:10,551
- Phil, why didn't you just tell me?
- Save it, Claire.

480
00:15:10,607 --> 00:15:12,030
I know you put the hit out
on my bear slippers.

481
00:15:12,085 --> 00:15:13,671
Those are just very unsexy.

482
00:15:13,726 --> 00:15:15,419
Oh, 'cause you always dress so sexy?

483
00:15:15,474 --> 00:15:16,843
Let's check out this nightwear.

484
00:15:19,015 --> 00:15:21,298
Luke's junior high gym shorts,
and the drawstring is an old shoelace.

485
00:15:21,354 --> 00:15:22,643
Well, at least I'm not
one of those wives

486
00:15:22,697 --> 00:15:24,014
that spends a fortune on lingerie.

487
00:15:24,069 --> 00:15:25,761
I mean, look, when the shoelace broke,

488
00:15:25,817 --> 00:15:27,078
I fixed it with a staple.

489
00:15:27,134 --> 00:15:28,934
Well, why don't we add a little spice
for our vacation?

490
00:15:28,989 --> 00:15:31,057
I mean, Gloria wears a floor-length,
beaded nightgown to bed.

491
00:15:31,113 --> 00:15:32,966
Wait a second. No, she doesn't.

492
00:15:33,775 --> 00:15:35,494
Yes.

493
00:15:35,608 --> 00:15:37,488
It looked very comfortable
on the website.

494
00:15:37,543 --> 00:15:39,236
Wait a minute. Gloria was with Mitchell.

495
00:15:39,292 --> 00:15:40,499
What have we got going on under here?!

496
00:15:40,555 --> 00:15:42,031
Okay, where were you going
looking so dapper?!

497
00:15:42,088 --> 00:15:43,699
Dapper? Really? Aww...

498
00:15:43,755 --> 00:15:45,071
Oh! Ooh! Manny. Manny!

499
00:15:45,125 --> 00:15:47,167
Hey! Look what just fell out
of Uncle Mitch's pocket!

500
00:15:47,222 --> 00:15:48,754
A second candy dish...

501
00:15:48,870 --> 00:15:50,938
Hold up. This is monogrammed.

502
00:15:50,993 --> 00:15:52,579
"M.O."?

503
00:15:52,635 --> 00:15:53,789
You went to Michelle Obama's without me?

504
00:15:55,456 --> 00:15:57,122
You went to Oprah Winfrey's without me?!

505
00:15:57,178 --> 00:15:58,467
Gloria, is this true?

506
00:15:58,522 --> 00:16:00,080
You know how I feel about Oprah.
She changed my...

507
00:16:00,136 --> 00:16:01,102
Excuse me.

508
00:16:01,157 --> 00:16:03,601
She gave me the strength
to change my own life!

509
00:16:07,437 --> 00:16:08,243
Stop. Stop!

510
00:16:08,297 --> 00:16:09,129
Stop!!

511
00:16:09,990 --> 00:16:11,361
Have we all forgotten that somebody

512
00:16:11,417 --> 00:16:12,678
cracked my boss's tiara?!

513
00:16:12,733 --> 00:16:13,807
I could get fired!

514
00:16:13,863 --> 00:16:14,856
Well, I touched it once,

515
00:16:14,911 --> 00:16:16,764
so I might have done it.
I'll pay for it.

516
00:16:16,792 --> 00:16:17,947
Hold on. Cam and I messed with it, too.

517
00:16:18,002 --> 00:16:19,048
- I put it on my hand.
- I tried it.

518
00:16:19,104 --> 00:16:20,393
- Me, too.
- Okay, okay, obviously,

519
00:16:20,449 --> 00:16:22,086
everybody monkeyed around
with it, so we'll all chip in.

520
00:16:22,142 --> 00:16:23,001
Really?

521
00:16:23,056 --> 00:16:23,968
- Yes!
- Thank you, guys.

522
00:16:24,024 --> 00:16:25,420
Yeah, let's go to bed!

523
00:16:26,336 --> 00:16:28,298
Listen, not to take Phil's side, but you
could wash those shorts

524
00:16:28,353 --> 00:16:30,260
'cause I'm getting a strong
whiff of elephant.

525
00:16:31,499 --> 00:16:32,922
Thanks for trying to help, Manny.

526
00:16:32,978 --> 00:16:35,422
I guess we'll really never know
who broke that tiara.

527
00:16:35,909 --> 00:16:37,091
I broke the tiara.

528
00:16:37,147 --> 00:16:38,489
I was alone at the house
the night before

529
00:16:38,544 --> 00:16:40,076
doing a little private wine tasting.

530
00:16:40,131 --> 00:16:41,688
I made a website,

531
00:16:41,744 --> 00:16:43,786
and I tell people how to live.

532
00:16:43,841 --> 00:16:45,614
Get a latte enema.

533
00:16:45,670 --> 00:16:46,926
Drink ocean water.

534
00:16:46,933 --> 00:16:47,765
Oh.

535
00:16:48,681 --> 00:16:49,674
Ooh...

536
00:16:49,729 --> 00:16:51,852
I knew if I said to my family,
"Do not touch",

537
00:16:51,907 --> 00:16:53,653
one of those bozos
would have to try it on

538
00:16:53,709 --> 00:16:56,099
and then think
they cracked it themselves.

539
00:16:56,154 --> 00:16:58,547
That's right. I'm a little
smarter than people think.

540
00:16:58,601 --> 00:17:00,698
But lucky, too. That moose
almost ruined everything.

541
00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:04,141
You know, there's no sense denying it.

542
00:17:04,170 --> 00:17:05,473
Life, as we know it, has changed.

543
00:17:05,502 --> 00:17:07,564
Yeah, yeah. From now on, you'll be
dancing on Tuesdays.

544
00:17:07,591 --> 00:17:09,707
Oh, Ronaldo's FaceTiming.

545
00:17:10,106 --> 00:17:11,158
<i>Hey, guys.</i>

546
00:17:11,186 --> 00:17:12,569
<i>So, uh, listen.</i>

547
00:17:12,966 --> 00:17:14,180
<i>Oprah knows about the candy dish.</i>

548
00:17:14,207 --> 00:17:15,729
I don't know what you're talking about.

549
00:17:15,756 --> 00:17:17,973
<i>There are cameras, Mitchell!</i>
<i>You need to bring it back.</i>

550
00:17:18,002 --> 00:17:18,848
Where are you?

551
00:17:18,877 --> 00:17:21,606
<i>I'm still here at Oprah's,</i>
<i>under my own free will.</i>

552
00:17:21,635 --> 00:17:24,400
<i>And I will probably</i>
<i>stay here in this tower</i>

553
00:17:24,455 --> 00:17:26,147
<i>until she gets her dish back.</i>

554
00:17:26,202 --> 00:17:28,110
<i>It's quite meaningful.</i>
<i>She stole it from...</i>

555
00:17:29,536 --> 00:17:31,498
<i>...got it as a gift from Michelle Obama.</i>

556
00:17:33,156 --> 00:17:34,606
- Oh, my God!
- Oh, my God!

557
00:17:34,689 --> 00:17:36,380
We have Michelle Obama's candy dish.

558
00:17:36,463 --> 00:17:38,154
Oprah Winfrey has our number.

559
00:17:38,237 --> 00:17:40,386
O-kay! Okay! Okay!

560
00:17:40,407 --> 00:17:44,435
