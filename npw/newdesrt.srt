Obviously, this is the living room.



2

There's a fully stocked bar in the den,

stock:1.股票

    2.v 进货 备有 

    3.I'm trying to change file 



3

and the home theater is downstairs.



4

Wow. So, your boss launches

one style website

launch: v deliver 

5

and she can afford all of this?                                 



6

I wish "1950s closeted father"



7

was a look people were clamoring for.



8

Oh, it is not that simple.



9

The formula for NERP is very specific...



10

former actress plus

confidence based on nothing



11

equals millions in sales

of iffy wellness products.

wellness:health

iffy:uncertain suspicious 

12

We should get her a gift

for letting us stay here,



13

but what do you give someone

who's researching



14

charcoal toothbrushes in Sri Lanka?

charcoal: 木炭

toothbrush: 

15

Oh, actually, she's judging



16

a placenta-cooking contest in Minsk.

placenta: 胎盘 

17

Maybe we should stay away

from the fridge.



18

So, we're in wine country.



19

When does the wine tasting start,



20

because I can use it after



21

the public bashing I've had to endure.

bash:猛击   try not bash into the wall

endure:         

22

Here we go. No more boo-hooing, Manny.



23

The review wasn't that bad.



24

He called my portrayal

of Inspector Poirot

portrayal:portrait

25

"unconvincing," "not believable,"



26

"hard to buy,"

and "ironically redundant".

redundant:extra 

27

Hey, Mitch, Cam,



28

now that you guys have had a chance



29

to sleep on my performance,



30

what did you think?



31

- It was a tricky part.

- Yeah, and I don't blame you.



32

I blame whoever cast you.

cast:抛

    计算

    演员阵容



33

Finally, the closet part of the tour.



34

My boss left each of you

a very special robe.

robe:long clothes

35

They minimize inflammation

inflammation:炎症 发火

36

and gently exfoliate your skin

exfoliate:使脱皮 

37

whilst you wear them.

whilst:while 当。。。的时候

38

That's weird. I only see six robes.



39

That's what's weird about them?



40

Oh, one last thing...



41

Do not touch the tiara

tiara:女性头饰 王冠



42

on display in the drawing room.



43

It is very delicate.



44

Got it?



45

Sorry, honey. You're just...

You're doing that thing



46

where you look like

a really intense baby deer.

intense:fierce, forceful 

deer: 鹿

47

Oh, the scarier you try to be,



48

- the more adorable you are.

- I know!



49

Whatever. I have, like,



50

a million errands to run for my boss.

errand:duty,task 



51

Hang on. Since, uh, no one's called dibs

dibs:

52

on the master bedroom,

I assume it's up for grabs.

master bedroom: main bedroom 主人的卧室 

up for grabs:可以争取 

grab:grasp grip seize cluth 

53

Oh, actually, there are only

three guest bedrooms upstairs,



54

so you'll have to sleep in there, okay?



55

The maid's quarters?

maid: demestic， 佣人

quarter:四分之一 住宿 



56

But I'll be right next

to the creaky do...

creaky: 老朽的 吱吱作响的 

57

You know, if you want,



58

- I can put some oil on that.

- Oh, no, no, no. Don't.



59

These are traditional

Tibetan creaking hinges.

creaking:嘎吱嘎吱声 发出嘎吱嘎吱声

hinge:脚链 门把 

60

We need those.

62

- Whoa. Go easy.

- Trust me, Dad.



63

Right now, I could really use this.



64

<i>I love Phil. Let's just

get that out of the way first,</i>

get that out of the way:  弄清楚 

65

but he has these bear slippers.

slipper:拖鞋

66

I don't know where they came from,



67

probably the same place that sells



68

pinky rings and other things

that make it difficult

pinky: a little pink  

69

to see your husband as a sexual being.



70

Oh, my gosh. I don't think

I'm allowed here



71

in my bare feet.

bare:bald naked uncovered

72

Fortunately, I have a tactic

tactic:strategy

73

for getting rid of things that I hate.



74

I suggest that Phil

brings them on vacation,



75

and then I forget to repack them.

pack:打包

76

Thanks.



77

Dollar-sign necktie...

necktie: neck - tie 

78

I flung it over Niagara Falls.

fling:cast 抛 扔

The belt buckle with "Pimp" in crystals?

crystal: 晶体 水晶 

80

Chucked it in the Grand Canyon.

chuck: cast , fling 

canyon: 峡谷 

81

Huh. I wonder if that's what Gloria did



82

to my denim vest in the Galápagos.

denim:粗布 丁尼布 

vest:背心 汗衫 

83

I just gotta sneak out tonight

sneak: 偷偷溜出 鬼鬼祟祟做 

84

and disappear those

bear slippers in the woods.

wood:forest 

85

Am I a terrible person?



86

No, but there might be a pattern

of desecrating national parks

desecrate:亵渎

you might want to look at.



88

That's enough, Chubs.



89

What are you doing?



90

Stella's been severely depressed

severely:badly ,seriously

depressed:dispirited     反:spirited  spirit 精神 

91 

because her best friend, Norman,



92

the next-door neighbor's dog, just died.



93

She won't even do

her favorite trick anymore.



94

Stella.



95

Stella, speak.



96

Speak. Like you're saying "Hello".



97

Hellooo! Hel-Hellooo!



98

Hello?



99

I wanted to bring Stella

on the trip to cheer her up.



100

She never sees seasons,

but Gloria wanted one night



101

with just the two of us in bed,



102

so I did the only sensible thing.

sensible:可感知到的 

    通情达理的 

103

You left her at home with a dog sitter?

sitter :待人照看小孩的 

    当模特的人 

104

Checked her in the hotel down the road.



105

I'm trying to get some wine in Gloria



106

so she passes out early

and I can sneak off and feed Stella.

pass out :喝的烂醉 



107

The hotel down the

road? You mean the Ritz?



108

I had points. Calm down.



109

Oh, how cool. This is both

an opener and a stopper.



110

Nice.



111

Oh, I guess what it does for bottles,



112

it also does for conversations.



113

Wait, is that... Ronaldo!



114

Mitchell!



115

What a surprise.



116

And who is this?



117

I always assumed I was

your sexiest Latin friend.



118

This is Gloria. Gloria, Ronaldo.



119

- Bolivian?

- Guatemalan.



120

- Venezuelan?

- Colombian.



121

- Mm-hmm.

- Not sure what this is.



122

Um, so w-what are you doing in town?



123

Oh, just picking up some wine

for a party I'm catering...

cater:筹办 提供酒食

124

at Oprah Winfrey's.



125

- What?

- Stop it!



126

- Oh, what, is that a big deal?

- Don't you be coy.

coy:shy ，忸怩作态的

127

You know the power dynamic

just shifted between us.



128

If you want, I can get you two

into the party.



129

- Get out!

- You would do that for us?



130

Only because I like you so much.



131

I like you so much, too!



132

That was a quick thaw.

thaw:解冻 

133

It can only be the two of you,

though. No Cameron.



134

Pepper would kill me.



135

Right. Cam's in a feud

with Ronaldo's husband



feud:dispute, fight  for long time 



136

over what type of cracker

belongs on a cheese platter.

cracker:cookie 饼干 

platter: 拼盘  唱片 



137

Water cracker. The cheese is the star.



138

- This isn't our fight.

- No.



139

I have to run.

I'll text you the address.



140

Okay. Bye-bye.



141

Can you believe this? We're

going to a party at Oprah's.



142

What if we become friends with her?



143

What if we get our own TV show?



144

Who's gonna pick up Joe from school?!



145

Gloria... we'll have drivers.



146

- Tuesday Company!

- Tuesday Company!



147

Cam, Mitch, Claire, and I signed

up for a hip-hop class.

hip-hop:即兴音乐 嘻哈 

148

We knew it was legit when they asked us



149

to graffiti our names

on the sign-up wall.



150

Right leg, come on.



151

Unh. Wrap those arms, come on.

wrap:缠绕 隐藏 

152

Unh. Unh.



153

And yah!



154

I like it. Nice job, everybody!



155

Great. That's great.



156

Hey, Sho Nuff. Bomb class.



157

Yeah, yeah. Really sick.



158

Hey, man. You two were hitting

it hard out there.



159

I was really believing your movements.



160

Are you... saying we brought it?



161

I'm saying y'all crushed it.

crush:压碎  迷恋 

162

Keep it up. All right?



163

- Okay.

- Hit it.



164

All right. There you go.



165

- Cameron?

- Philip?



166

- Did you hear that?

- You mean when our dance instructor



167

told us we were basically

street-dance superstars?



168

Did you notice how he singled us out?

single： adj 

     v choose  

169

He didn't even mention Mitch or Claire.



170

It's like he's

saying they're holding us back.

hold sb back :阻碍 。。前进 

171

Okay. You know what?



172

We need to shed our dead-weight spouses.

shed: 拜托 流出 

dead-weight :沉重的

spouse:配偶 

173

There is nobody

I would rather impress more



174

- than Sho Nuff.

- True dat.

     ==== True that 



175

- No, True Dat's just the DJ.

- I don't care what he thinks.



176

Turns out, Cam and I

make tremendous dance partners.

tremendous:amazing  ,  fantastic ,giant

177

Our bodies are so in tune,

in tune :和谐一致 

178

it's like we finish each other's...



179

...sequences.

        顺序 ，顺序事件

180

Phil starts a move,

and I instinctually complete it.

instinctual: 本能的

181

And, yeah,

it's as powerful as it sounds.



182

Oh, my gosh. Did you ever think



183

a farm boy from Missouri



184

and... and a real-estate agent

from Key West, Florida,



185

would get the opportunity to audition

audition: 试音 面试   audience听众 

186

for the prestigious Tuesday Company?

prestigious:honored 有声望的 

187

And it only costs slightly more

than regular classes.



188

We could be the greatest

masters-level hip-hop duo

duo: 二人组合 

189

- since Pump Up and The Jam!

- I know!



190

Callback's tomorrow, so

we'll have to sneak out tonight



191

for a final rehearsal.



192

You... You brought the outfit

in case we got it, right?



193

"In case"? Good one, Phil.



194

I'm having a hard time resisting

dancing with joy, are you?



195

- Me-Meet at the grapes.

- Okay.



196

Man, it took forever

to find a parking spot.



197

I could really use a

sip of a chewy Cabernet.



198

You can't drink. You have to stay sober

to drive the rest of us home.



199

Wait, is that why I'm here?

To be the designated driver?



200

If you need a title, sure.



201

Okay, the front door's too loud.



202

We can get to the driveway this way.



203

I look like Miss Universe.



204

What are you doing?

Haley said not to touch that.



205

- Ow!

- Let me see.



206

Clean cut.



207

- Those are real diamonds!

- Leave 'em. Come on.



208

- Cam, walk this way.

- Oh. Ooh, ooh, ooh!



209

Mixing metals is very

in-fashion right now.



210

No, no. Hey, hey, hey, hey.



211

In 18 hours, Sho Nuff is gonna

be rating our dance skills



212

on a scale of one to "Dayum"! Come on!



213

All right. All right.



214

Butt... here.



215

Just one more treat.



216

Here.



217

Shh. We'll just do this quick.



218

Shh. Here you go.



219

Gorgeous!



220

- Dad?

- Oh!



221

I thought you were Gloria.



222

Wh-Why is Stella here?



223

I was going to feed her at the hotel...



224

she's clearly in a bad way.



225

She trashed the room.



226

It looked like The Who

was staying there.



227

So, I'm gonna stash her

in the guesthouse,



228

brush her fur until she goes to sleep.



229

Stella!



230

What?



231

I am prom queen?!



232

It's not... It's not Ashley Walls



233

who got the pity vote

after her car accident?



234

Thank you.



235

Thank you.



236

Okay. Now we need to be

strategic if we're gonna hit



237

all of Oprah's important rooms, okay?



238

Her home office, her gift-wrapping room,



239

her temperature-controlled vault

of cozy sweaters.



240

But what if Gayle is there?



241

Do we stop to talk to her?



242

No. No Gayle. There's no time.



243

Okay, that-that's the third house



244

in this compound that we passed.



245

How will we know when we get



246

to Oprah's actual hou...



247

Oh, my God.



248

Okay.



249

I'm so sorry.



250

I'm sorry.



251

- I was a beat early on the booty drop.

- No, no, no.



252

It was me. I was a beat late

on the chest pop.



253

It's weird, but I'm... I'm nervous.



254

I am, too. But you know what?



255

We... We just have to relax



256

and remember we're... we're

just a couple guys dancing.



257

Who are we kidding?!



258

Getting Tuesday Company would be epic!



259

I know! We get our own cubbies.



260

We don't have to throw our

keys and wallet in the corner anymore.



261

Didn't the Tuesdoggs perform at

the WNBA All-Star Game last year?



262

It would be life-changing, but

we have to stop talking about



263

how great it would be.



264

- That's what's throwing us off.

- Right.



265

- For now, it's... We're just... Hey.

- Hey.



266

- Here's two guys...

- Dancing.



267

- We're dancing. Yeah.

- We're dancing.



268

- Let's take it from the top. All right.

- Yep.



269

Five, six, seven, eight, and...



270

And that's my bad.



271

Okay.



272

Where have you been? I turned

around and you were gone.



273

I was in Oprah's bed!



274

- Guess her sleep number.

- I don't have to.



275

- I touched her. I touched Oprah!

- What?!



276

Well, technically,



277

I brushed the edge

of her gown with my finger.



278

But look... my cut's magically healed.



279

And I heard they have baby elephants



280

carrying everyone to the south lawn



281

to see a living chess match. Let's go!



282

Wait, no, Gloria. Gloria, Come on.



283

We said we'd only stay for an hour.



284

We have to get back to our normal lives.



285

- But how?!

- I know.



286

Leave them.



287

Take it from me... if you get

a second chance at love,



288

you grab it.



289

<i>After the trauma of losing

her best friend, Norman,</i>



290

<i>Stella's veil of depression was lifted</i>



291

<i>by the promise of new romance.</i>



292

She realized she could love again.



293

You can't separate them, Claire.



294

I'm taking that slipper home with me.



295

And risk Phil seeing it the next

time we're at your house? Forget it.



296

Stella's had her fun. This is over.



297

Why is this so hard for you to accept?



298

Is it because it's a dog and a slipper?



299

My bad.



300

- Again.

- No, no. No, no.



301

That's on me. I'm... I'm...

I'm... I'm still in my head.



302

Let's face it, Cam.

This isn't about nerves.



303

It's about me losing

whatever spark I once had.



304

It's like someone sucked

the funk right out of me!



305

No, I'm the problem. It's like I've lost

the key to the lock on my pop.



306

Just...go on without me.



307

I'm holding you back!

I mean, nuff is nuff.



308

Maybe Rob Base was wrong.

It takes one to make a thing go right.



309

- Is it possible...

- Just say it.



310

...that we're just Monday dancers?



311

Is it better?



312

No, I'm still getting

a hint of elephant.



313

- Get out.

- W... I'm just being honest.



314

No, we have to push the car

the last 50 feet to the house...



315

...so that they don't hear us coming.



316

I feel like some of Oprah's strength

must've rubbed off on me.



317

I bet I could

carry this car up.



318

Are you sure this is in neutral?



319

What is this?!



320

Did you steal this candy dish

from Oprah's house?



321

It has her initials engraved.



322

I couldn't help it. I wanted a souvenir.



323

But you said that we couldn't

bring any evidence in here,



324

and you didn't even let me take



325

the party napkin that had a cartoon



326

of her hugging children of many colors!



327

Okay, I'm sorry.



328

What if... What if we share

custody of the candy dish?



329

Okay, fine.



330

But I get it for the holidays.



331

Coming.



332

Oh, hey, sorry. I forgot my keys

in the drawing room.



333

Okay, where did I put them?



334

They were right here, right?



335

And right where I thought I left them.



336

Wait a minute. What is that?



337

Oh, my God.



338

Oh, my God! The tiara! It's cracked!



339

Who did this?!



340

I'll get to the bottom of this.



341

I don't care what some

feeble-minded vulgarian says.



342

Manny Delgado knows how to play

the role of an inspector.



343

- I'll text everyone to come downstairs.

- Thank you.



344

No!



345

Oh, no.



346

Oh, hell no.



347

Okay. Wait, wait, Dad.

We need an excuse!



348

People are gonna wonder

why we weren't in bed.



349

Um, tell them that, uh, uh...



350

Oh! We were on the balcony

because we saw a moose.



351

That's dumb.



352

We'll tell them I'm heating up some milk

for you in the kitchen



353

because your stomach hurts.



354

Why? Because I was upset

that I saw a moose?



355

Put this on.



356

- I was early.

- I was late.



357

Hurry, hurry!



358

Whew! I'm still getting

strong notes of elephant off of you.



359

- You may have to cut off all your hair.

- No!



360

I'm sure you're wondering why

I've gathered you all here.



361

Uh, the tiara's cracked.

You told us in your text.



362

What I didn't tell you

is that I've vowed



363

to find out who's responsible.



364

Well, no, actually,

you did. It was a fairly long...



365

Everyone's a suspect.



366

Don't look at me.

I wasn't anywhere near it.



367

What a surprise...

Phil feigning innocence.



368

You're just everyone's

favorite Dad, right?



369

Where were you when you got my text?



370

Cam's, uh, stomach was upset,



371

and I was warming up some milk for him.



372

- Claire saw a moose.

- I did.



373

And that's why we were on

the balcony when you texted us.



374

Well, Gloria and I were in the den.



375

I ran into her on my way out to my walk,



376

and then we decided

to watch the moon together.



377

The moon, huh?



378

Seems unlikely given tonight

is moonless!



379

No matter.



380

So, did any of you go through

this room at any point?



381

Sounds to me like everybody was inside



382

doing whatever they were

supposed to be doing.



383

That's odd because I found

this door slightly open,



384

which means one of you was outside.



385

When I find out who went out that door,



386

quite sure I'll have my culprit.



387

Hey, what's that?



388

It appears to be two bottom halves



389

of a gingerbread man melded together.



390

Uh, it looks like a bone.

It's a dog treat.



391

No, it's a human treat,



392

and it's shaped like

a bone because it's full of calcium.



393

I was snacking on them

earlier in the day



394

and I must have dropped one.



395

Mmm, they're delicious.



396

And they're very good for you.



397

Checks out.



398

That's coming from upstairs!



399

No, outside.



400

Gloria, how did this happen?



401

I have a theory.



402

I once read about a moose



403

that knocked a camper out of neutral.



404

Perhaps the moose Claire saw earlier did

the same thing here.



405

The hood's warm. Then don't lean on it.



406

I admit it! Mitch and I...

we were outside.



407

He wanted to talk to me about a problem



408

he's having with Cam in the gay bedroom.



409

Oh, so when it's me, it's a problem.



410

When it's you, it's what happens

when you work out too much.



411

It got cold, we went inside the car,



412

I turned the heater on,



413

and I must have accidentally

knocked it into neutral.



414

So, it was all ready to roll

when the moose showed up.



415

Hey, uh, what's

this candy dish doing here?



416

Haley, please, I'm trying to think.



417

But it could be evidence.



418

What are the lights doing on

in the tennis court?!



419

Now why would these chairs be out here,



420

and how do they connect to the moose?



421

These footprints are in a...

really weird pattern.



422

Why do these steps feel so familiar?



423

Cam and I were out here, um...



424

We were in the kitchen, and

we heard a raccoon outside.



425

Yeah, yeah. So, we came out, we...



426

we grabbed a couple chairs

to... to... to scare it off.



427

We held... held them up like this,



428

and, um, chased the raccoon,



429

but it ran into some trash cans

and we were like...



430

- Oh!

- Oh!



431

And then, uh, it ran

up the court this way...



432

- Yep.

- ...and then back a couple of steps



433

and then forward again and then it

did a little spin.



434

Yep. That was it. And then it

came back at us, and we were like...



435

Right, left. Right, right,



436

body roll, and spin.



437

And then, it was just gone.



438

What the hell was that?



439

What is any of this? I can't

make sense of these clues.



440

What kind of raccoon isn't scared off by

the presence of a moose?



441

All we need to know



442

is that Mitchell, Gloria, Cam, and Phil



443

- are the four and only suspects.

- Not only!



444

One at a time! Phil, go first.



445

Well, that's a lot of pressure.



446

Speak!



447

What is that noise?



448

It's like a dog saying, "Hello."



449

Sounds to me like

a California barking moose.



450

It came from up there.



451

Hey.



452

We were really in-sync talking

through that raccoon chase.



453

It felt like maybe we

had our timing back again.



454

It really did.



455

Maybe we forgot dance isn't

about the fame or... or glory,



456

but it's about telling a story

that takes your audience



457

on a journey that ebbs and flows.



458

Ebb and Flow.



459

I think we just found our hip-hop names.



460

Jay!



461

- You brought Stella?!

- No!



462

She must have tracked us here.



463

What's that, girl?



464

What? We left the stove on?



465

- Well, that was weird.

- Wait, wait. Whoa, whoa.



466

What is my slipper doing in here?



467

I'm not wrong. It's cold, huh?



468

Hey. Honey...



469

We need to talk about this.



470

- Um, Stella...

- She wants the slipper, Phil.



471

Oh, my God.



472

W-Why is Phil dressed

like a Beastie Boy?



473

Wait a minute. Wait a minute.



474

You two did hip-hop without us!



475

Okay, be-because you and Claire

were holding us back.



476

Oh, please. We are

just as good as you are.



477

It sounds like somebody

wants a dance-off.



478

No. No one ever wants a dance-off.



479

- Phil, why didn't you just tell me?

- Save it, Claire.



480

I know you put the hit out

on my bear slippers.



481

Those are just very unsexy.



482

Oh, 'cause you always dress so sexy?



483

Let's check out this nightwear.



484

Luke's junior high gym shorts,

and the drawstring is an old shoelace.



485

Well, at least I'm not

one of those wives



486

that spends a fortune on lingerie.



487

I mean, look, when the shoelace broke,



488

I fixed it with a staple.



489

Well, why don't we add a little spice

for our vacation?



490

I mean, Gloria wears a floor-length,

beaded nightgown to bed.



491

Wait a second. No, she doesn't.



492

Yes.



493

It looked very comfortable

on the website.



494

Wait a minute. Gloria was with Mitchell.



495

What have we got going on under here?!



496

Okay, where were you going

looking so dapper?!



497

Dapper? Really? Aww...



498

Oh! Ooh! Manny. Manny!



499

Hey! Look what just fell out

of Uncle Mitch's pocket!



500

A second candy dish...



501

Hold up. This is monogrammed.



502

"M.O."?



503

You went to Michelle Obama's without me?



504

You went to Oprah Winfrey's without me?!



505

Gloria, is this true?



506

You know how I feel about Oprah.

She changed my...



507

Excuse me.



508

She gave me the strength

to change my own life!



509

Stop. Stop!



510

Stop!!



511

Have we all forgotten that somebody



512

cracked my boss's tiara?!



513

I could get fired!



514

Well, I touched it once,



515

so I might have done it.

I'll pay for it.



516

Hold on. Cam and I messed with it, too.



517

- I put it on my hand.

- I tried it.



518

- Me, too.

- Okay, okay, obviously,



519

everybody monkeyed around

with it, so we'll all chip in.



520

Really?



521

- Yes!

- Thank you, guys.



522

Yeah, let's go to bed!



523

Listen, not to take Phil's side, but you

could wash those shorts



524

'cause I'm getting a strong

whiff of elephant.



525

Thanks for trying to help, Manny.



526

I guess we'll really never know

who broke that tiara.



527

I broke the tiara.



528

I was alone at the house

the night before



529

doing a little private wine tasting.



530

I made a website,



531

and I tell people how to live.



532

Get a latte enema.



533

Drink ocean water.



534

Oh.



535

Ooh...



536

I knew if I said to my family,

"Do not touch",



537

one of those bozos

would have to try it on



538

and then think

they cracked it themselves.



539

That's right. I'm a little

smarter than people think.



540

But lucky, too. That moose

almost ruined everything.



541

You know, there's no sense denying it.



542

Life, as we know it, has changed.



543

Yeah, yeah. From now on, you'll be

dancing on Tuesdays.



544

Oh, Ronaldo's FaceTiming.



545

<i>Hey, guys.</i>



546

<i>So, uh, listen.</i>



547

<i>Oprah knows about the candy dish.</i>



548

I don't know what you're talking about.



549

<i>There are cameras, Mitchell!</i>

<i>You need to bring it back.</i>



550

Where are you?



551

<i>I'm still here at Oprah's,</i>

<i>under my own free will.</i>



552

<i>And I will probably</i>

<i>stay here in this tower</i>



553

<i>until she gets her dish back.</i>



554

<i>It's quite meaningful.</i>

<i>She stole it from...</i>



555

<i>...got it as a gift from Michelle Obama.</i>



556

- Oh, my God!

- Oh, my God!



557

We have Michelle Obama's candy dish.



558

Oprah Winfrey has our number.



559

O-kay! Okay! Okay!
